Look for a Open Zeppelin version of this Lib: BytesLib
- If I am not mistaken, OZ just published a more efficient lib.

What about access control over CCIP functions?
- Do we need to have it? I mean, we will not keep anything in the contracts. How could anyone break the functionality and take advantage of it?

How to ensure stake completion?
- Uniswap Pools will vary according to price action. Which means, 15-25 minutes later, they will not be the same as the ones the payload has.


What if the user has a meme coin and want to completely swap for a token that will be deposited?
- The frontend will have an whitelist for which tokens are allowed. However, this restriction will not be present on the smart contract level. In a scenario in which an user deposits MEMECOIN/USDC, only 50% of our fee will be charge on the MEME/COIN and so, we are not taking 100% os the risk.
